# Artwork Discovery App

## About the Project

The Artwork Discovery App is a mobile application designed to provide an immersive augmented reality (AR) experience, allowing users to explore and engage with a wide range of artworks. Utilizing AR technology, the app renders life-sized art installations in real-time, enabling users to visualize and interact with the art pieces in their own space.

## Features

- **Explore Artworks**: Users can browse a carousel of featured artworks, each with detailed descriptions to pique interest and engagement.
- **Augmented Reality Experience**: The app offers a unique AR feature where users can place the artworks in their environment, experiencing the art as if it were physically present.
- **Interactive Video Content**: Each artwork comes with an accompanying video, providing a deeper understanding of the art piece and its historical or cultural significance.
- **User-Generated Content**: With the 'Create Project' feature, users can contribute their own art, making the app a platform for both discovery and exhibition.

## Screens

- **Main Screen**: Showcases the carousel of available artworks and access to AR viewing.
- **Artwork Detail Screen**: Provides detailed information about the artwork, including a rich description and video content.
- **Create Project Screen**: Allows users to upload their art and descriptions, contributing to the app's collection.

## AR Functionality
